# Javascript To-Do List Assignment by T-Ralph

## Requirements
Your assignment is to create a To-Do list using HTML and Javascript. CSS is optional. This assignment will focus on DOM manipulation and working with arrays. The following screenshot shows what a To-Do App might look like. Your To-Do App can look different. It can have its own style and design and you can add features. This assignment is meant to be flexible to provide you with an opportunity to show your individual talents. Start by building the Mandatory Requirements then expand upon the application as you see fit. Don’t forget to make a lot of commits along the way. Even if you are unable to finish we would still like to see your code so don’t wait until the end of the project to push your code to github.
